Spend a max of 30-60 mins trying to do it. If you can't then watch the video and try to pick out what he is doing and why. Then try and do it on your own. If you still don't understand then code along until you have it working and then delete and try to build it again from scratch. Try not build from memorisation code you previously wrote or from pattern recognition but instead by trying to remember 'how' it was done.

## Project Brief:

- When you click a specific key it will play a particulr drum noise.
- HTML element needs to have a sound.
- Element needs a click animation.

## Task List:


1. Download starter files DONE
2. Create HTML structure with audio elements with audio files
3. Add event listener which adds a class of 'playing' whenever the corresponding key is clicked
4. The 'playing' class should apply CSS which creates a yellow border and box-shadow. 
5. The keydown event should map to the corresponding keycode e.g. A = 65.
